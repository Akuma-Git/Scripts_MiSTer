Miscellaneous Bash scripts for MiSTer from other authors


###### build_mame_roms.sh by self_slaughter

Small script based on locutus73s updater, to search github for official build scripts to
convert mame arcade roms into something suitable for the MiSTer and copy them into /media/fat/bootrom
so they will autoload when you start the appropriate core.

Contains an ARM compiled version of Floating IPS v1.31 which currently is only used
to build the rom for Arkanoid.

Download for the source code used for this build is located at https://www.smwcentral.net/?p=section&a=details&id=11474
